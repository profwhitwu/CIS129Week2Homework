//  1. Use explicit typing to define a variable to represent a first name.  Use that variable to store your first name.

//  2. Using the variable defined above, print out its value using Console.WriteLine.

//  3. Use implicit typing to define a variable to represent your last name.Use that variable to store your last name.

//  6. Say we have a varaible whose value can only be true or false, but also could contain null.
//  Define that variable here and store a value of true in it.

//  7. Create a variable that holds that holds the monetary value of $5.99.

//  8. Using explicit typing, create a variable to hold the value of 2147483648.
//  The variable must be an integral numeric type. 

//  9. Create a tuple that contains one string, and one int value.

//  10. Using the tuple you created above, use Console.WriteLine to
//  print the value of the first item of the tuple to the console.

//  4. Create an enum type that represents different kinds of movie genres (i.e. Action, Adventure, Romance).
//  Then define a variable that stores one of these genres.

//  5. Create a structure of a person, named Person.  The structure should have the following properties:
//  FirstName, LastName, Age.  You do not need to create an instance of this record.

//  11. Copy your structure from question 5, and call it AnotherPerson.
//  Replace the struct keyword with a reference type that will allow us to measure equality BY VALUE.

//  12. Make another copy of your structure from question 5, and call it YetAnotherPerson.
//  Replace the struct keyword with a reference type that will allow us to measure equality BY ADDRESS.
